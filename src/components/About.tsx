            Over the past two years, I've focused on honing my programming
            skills, particularly in full-stack development using ReactJS,
            NextJS, NodeJS, and NestJS.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            My journey began with diving into ReactJS and NextJS, exploring
            their scalability and customization in web development. I then
            delved into NodeJS and NestJS, captivated by their depth and
            flexibility. Working on full-stack projects, I've built user
            interfaces and backend systems, utilizing the features of these
            technologies to create robust web applications.
